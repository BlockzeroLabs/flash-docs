What is Flashstake?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Flashstake is a permissionless protocol that allows anyone to earn instant upfront yield through various underlying
Flash Strategies.


How does Flashstake work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a nutshell, each time a user stakes, they receive fTokens. These fTokens can be burned proportionally to redeem
yield in a given protocol.

We suggest reviewing the Protocol Overview and Core Concepts from the sidebar to gain a better understanding.


**Miscellaneous**
-----------------

Does using Flash Protocol generate taxable events?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We cannot provide tax or accounting advice. Tax regulations are specific
to jurisdiction where you or your company reside. For any legal or tax
matters we recommend consulting your own attorney.

Are there risks in using Flashstake?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Flashstake Protocol smart contracts have been designed with security as a top priority. The core protocol code
has been reviewed and audited by multiple auditors (of course, we cannot guarantee that bugs wonâ€™t be found in the
future.)
