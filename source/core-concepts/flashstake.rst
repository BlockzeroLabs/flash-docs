Flashstake
===============

Flashstaking is a combined action of staking principal tokens (minting fTokens) and redeeming (FlashBurn) the received
fTokens for yield all in one transaction. The Flashstake Protocol offers a function called flashStake, enabling users
to execute this action. Additionally, users can specify a slippage value to prevent their transaction from being
frontrun.

Staking
-------

Users can interact with the Flash Protocol and Stake principal tokens into one of the registered Strategies. The
strategy determines the number of fTokens to mint and the Flash Protocol mints these to the user's wallet.

.. note::
    fTokens represent the yield the user is entitled to. :doc:`You can read more about fTokens here. </core-concepts/ftokens>`

Burning
-------

Users holding fTokens can swap or burn these for some amount of underlying yield generated by the corresponding strategy.
