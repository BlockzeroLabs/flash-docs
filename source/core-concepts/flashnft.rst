FlashNFT
===============

The Flashstake Protocol has been designed from the ground up to be sustainable and to ensure it can be used as a lego
block within the decentralised finance industry. There have been various decisions made to ensure third party protocols
can interact with the Flashstake Protocol on-chain. One of these decisions is the introduction of the FlashNFT.

.. important::
    FlashNFT's represent Stakes within the Flash Protocol.

Users can choose to mint an NFT to represent their Stake during the staking process or some time after the Stake has
been created.

The ownership of the Stake is handed over to the NFT which means the NFT owner now owns the
associated Stake within the Flashstake Protocol. The Stake cannot be interacted with without the associated NFT.


.. note::
    Developer Note: It is possible to use the NFT token id to determine all the information for the associated Stake
    within the Flashstake protocol.
