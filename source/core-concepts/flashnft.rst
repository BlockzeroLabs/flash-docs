The Flashstake Protocol has been engineered to be durable and suitable for integration as a building block within
the decentralized finance sector. Several measures have been implemented to enable third-party protocols to interact
with the Flashstake Protocol on-chain. One such measure is the implementation of the FlashNFT.

.. important::
    FlashNFT's represent Stakes within the Flash Protocol.

Users have the choice to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) to represent their stake during the staking process or at a
later date. The FlashNFT can be transferred to another address which subsequently transfers the ownership of the stake.

Once an NFT has been minted, the stake cannot be accesses or modified in any way without the associated NFT.

For developers, it is possible to utilize the NFT token id to retrieve all the information pertaining to the
corresponding stake within the Flashstake Protocol.
