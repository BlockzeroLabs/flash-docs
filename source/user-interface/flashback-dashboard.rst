Flashback Dashboard
==========================

The Stake Dashboard allows you to see all your active stakes and perform actions with them.
More specifically, from the Dashboard, you can:

#. `Select a stake from the list`_
#. `Unstake part or all of your staked funds early`_
#. `Withdraw your funds when the stake is finished`_

.. _Select a stake from the list:

.. note::
    **Only active stakes are shown in the Dashboard.**
    Active stakes are stakes still containing funds.
    For example, if a stake is over but you didn't withdraw your funds, that stake will still be considered active.
    If you withdraw a stake, it will become inactive and disappear from the Dashboard.
